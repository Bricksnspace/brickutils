README for BrickUtils

This is an utility for MOC builder.
It was actively developed from 2012 to 2015. 
I don't have much time, so I put last release here.  

Feature list:

* Imports LDD project file (LXF or LXFML)
* Imports BrickLink set inventory, store inventory, order inventory
* Imports LDraw file format (MPD or LDR)
* Manage your collection of bricks, sets and bulk lots
* Display brick shape in 3D (from LDraw part library)
* Checks if you can build a model (from LDD, LDraw or a BrickLink set) against your brick catalog, and helps you to find alternate bricks
* Exports BrickLink "Wanted Mass Upload" XML file, to buy bricks on BrickLink
* Exports lists in printable HTML to helps pick bricks from your collection (a bill of materials)
* Exports wanted lists in user-defined format via templates (see manual)
* New releases check at startup
* Database update via Internet
* Imports and exports your bricks and sets catalog in XML format, for backup and upgrades
* Faster full text search in BrickLink and LDraw databases
* "Can Build?" function now includes an "export" button to create a wanted mass upload file from missing bricks, accepted by BrickLink
